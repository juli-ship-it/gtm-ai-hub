- **Authentication** integrated with existing GTM Hub auth

### UI Components

- **Responsive design** with Workleap branding

- **Accessibility features** for inclusive learning
- **Mobile-optimized** for learning on the go

## Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup

Run the migrations to create the HR University tables:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

This will create all necessary tables and seed them with sample data.

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` includes:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### 3. Slack Integration (Optional)

To enable Slack notifications for intake requests:

1. Deploy the `slack-hr-intake` Edge Function
2. Configure Slack webhook URLs
3. Update the API route to call the Edge Function

### 4. Access the HR University

Navigate to `/hr-university` in your GTM Hub application.

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the primary goal of fairness in AI ethics?",
    "options": [
      "Speed up hiring decisions",
      "Ensure AI systems do not discriminate",
      "Reduce costs",
      "Automate all HR processes"
    ],
    "correct_index": 1
  }
]
```

## Customization

### Styling

The HR University uses Workleap design tokens and custom CSS classes:

- `.hr-university-card` - Module and lesson cards
- `.hr-university-badge` - Difficulty and status badges
- `.hr-university-progress` - Progress indicators
- `.hr-university-quiz-option` - Quiz answer options

### Branding

Update the design tokens in `globals.css` to match your organization's branding:

```css
:root {
  --wl-accent: #4F46E5;    /* Primary color */
  --wl-accent-2: #22C55E;  /* Secondary color */
  --wl-text: #0F172A;      /* Text color */
  --wl-muted: #64748B;     /* Muted text */
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- **Row Level Security** ensures users only see their own progress
- **Encrypted data** in transit and at rest
- **Access controls** based on user roles
- **Audit logging** for compliance

### Privacy Considerations

- **Minimal data collection** for learning analytics
- **User consent** for progress tracking
- **Data retention** policies for compliance
- **GDPR compliance** for EU users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Progress not saving** - Check RLS policies and user authentication
2. **Quiz not submitting** - Verify quiz JSON format and validation
3. **Slack integration failing** - Check Edge Function deployment and credentials
4. **Styling issues** - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
